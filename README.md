RecipeVideoMaker

RecipeVideoMaker is a helper tool designed specifically for the
Mineral Balance Diet Android App.

It converts recipe text and Android app screenshots generated by the app into short narrated recipe videos, suitable for publishing on video platforms such as YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok.

This tool is part of the Mineral Balance Diet content workflow.
It is not a general-purpose video editor.

Mineral Balance Diet Android App (Google Play):

What problem does this tool solve?

The Mineral Balance Diet Android App can automatically generate nutritionally balanced daily recipes.

However, most social platforms require video rather than text or screenshots.

RecipeVideoMaker solves this final step by turning:

Mineral Balance Diet App
→ recipe screens on your phone
→ narrated recipe video

There is no manual video editing, no screen recording, and no voice-over work.

Who is this tool for?

This tool is intended for:

Nutritionists

Diet and health content creators

Operators of the Mineral Balance Diet Android App

No programming background is required.
This document assumes you have never used Python or command-line tools before.

What you need before starting

You need:

A Windows computer

An Android phone

Internet access

Step 1 — Install Python

RecipeVideoMaker runs on Python.
Python is simply a program that allows this tool to run. You do not need to learn programming.

To install Python on Windows:

Open a web browser and go to the official Python website at python.org.
Download the latest Python 3 version.
Run the installer.

On the first installation screen, make sure the option “Add Python to PATH” is checked.
Then continue the installation until it finishes.

After installation, Python is ready for use.

Step 2 — Install edge-tts

edge-tts is used to generate spoken narration from recipe text.

Install edge-tts using Python’s package installer.
If the installation completes without errors, edge-tts is ready.

No additional configuration is required.

Step 3 — Install ffmpeg

ffmpeg is used to create the video from images and audio.

Download ffmpeg from its official website.
Choose a Windows build and download the static version.

After extracting the download, locate the files named ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe.

Place both files in the same folder as RecipeVideoMaker.

Once this is done, ffmpeg is ready.

Step 4 — Capture recipe screens from your Android phone

RecipeVideoMaker uses screenshots taken directly from the Mineral Balance Diet Android App.

Screenshots must follow this naming format:

01.png, 02.png, 03.png, and so on.

Two-digit numbering is required to guarantee correct ordering when many images are used.

This project already includes the tools needed to capture screenshots:

shot_here.bat

device.txt

You do not need to create these files.

Enable Android screenshot access

On your Android phone:

Open Settings and go to About phone.
Tap the Build number multiple times until Developer mode is enabled.
Return to Settings, open Developer options, and enable USB debugging.

Connect your phone to the computer using a USB cable.

Configure device.txt

Open the file named device.txt located in the project folder.

Replace its contents with your phone’s device ID on a single line.
This ID is shown when your phone is connected and recognized by the system.

Save the file.

How the screenshot bat file works

The file shot.bat is a helper tool that captures one screen at a time from your Android phone.

Each time you use it:

It captures the current screen shown on your phone

It saves the image into the project folder

It automatically names the image using two-digit numbering

You use this tool step by step, matching the order of recipe screens in the app.

Capture recipe screens

Open the Mineral Balance Diet app on your phone and navigate to the first recipe screen.

Open the Mineral Balance Diet app on your phone and navigate to the first recipe screen.

Use the screenshot tool from a Windows command-line window (DOS window) as follows.

The screenshot tool is a file ending with .bat.
It is run by typing its file name in the command-line window.

In the command-line window, enter:

shot.bat 1

This runs the screenshot tool and generates the first image.
It captures the current screen shown on the phone and saves it as 01.png.

Then, move to the next recipe screen on your phone and enter:

shot.bat 2

This generates the second image, saved as 02.png.

In other words:

Number 1 means the first image

Number 2 means the second image

Each run captures one screen only

You should run the screenshot tool step by step, following the order of recipe screens:

First page → shot.bat 1 → 01.png
Second page → shot.bat 2 → 02.png
Third page → shot.bat 3 → 03.png

Repeat this process until all required recipe screens are captured.

All images should be in the same folder as RecipeVideoMaker.

All images should be in the same folder as RecipeVideoMaker.

Step 5 — Prepare script.txt

script.txt contains the narration text for the video.

Each line corresponds to one image:

The first line describes 01.png.
The second line describes 02.png.
The third line describes 03.png.

Write clear, simple recipe narration.
One sentence per line is recommended.

Step 6 — Generate the video using the Python file

RecipeVideoMaker.py is the main program that creates the video.

When you run it:

It reads all images in numeric order

It reads the narration text from script.txt

It generates spoken audio using text-to-speech

It creates short video segments from each image

It combines everything into one final video

The final output file is named output.mp4.

Supported languages

RecipeVideoMaker supports narration in 27 languages, including English and Chinese.

The language is selected when running the tool.

Output files

After successful completion, the folder will contain:

output.mp4, the final narrated recipe video

tts_failed.txt, which appears only if some narration lines fail

Notes

Image order is determined strictly by number.
Two-digit numbering is required for stability.

If narration fails due to network issues, running the tool again usually resolves the problem.

All recipe content is assumed to originate from the Mineral Balance Diet Android App.
